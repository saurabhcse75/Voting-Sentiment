# Voting-Sentiment

# Sentiment Voting Smart Contract

## Overview
This Solidity smart contract implements a basic sentiment-based voting mechanism. Users can cast votes, and the contract keeps track of the total number of votes.

## Features
- Allows users to vote.
- Tracks the total number of votes.

## Smart Contract Code
The contract is written in Solidity and requires an Ethereum-compatible blockchain to deploy.

## Usage
1. Deploy the contract using a Solidity-compatible environment (Remix, Hardhat, Truffle, etc.).
2. Users can call the `vote` function to cast their vote.
3. The total number of votes is stored in the `totalVotes` variable.
